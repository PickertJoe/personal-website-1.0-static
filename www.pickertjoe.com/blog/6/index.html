            <p class='content-markdown'>In today&#39;s development news, we&#39;re working with adding text animations to the home page. 

As I see it now, I&#39;d like for the user to enter my site through a home page that features only my navbar and the stunning backdrop of Mt. Elbert in all its snowy glory. Then, after a second or two, the welcome messages will fade in over the background. I&#39;d think I&#39;d like to give the user the additional option of a button to hide the welcome text if they&#39;d just like to look at the background image for a moment. This extra feature would just be icing on the cake to me though, as I&#39;m not sure how difficult it might be to implement. It would likely involve some Javascript, in which I still have little experience. There may be a Bootstrap component for this as well; I&#39;ll have to investigate!


Implementing the first part of this vision was pretty fun and easy. Having never worked with animations in CSS before, I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward the process was. I simply designated the welcome messages with a custom class, and specified the animation properties in my custom CSS file. To make things easy, I simply named the animation &#39;fade in.&#39; From there, I just had to define the @keyframes for the animation name. As it was just a basic fade animation, the definition was as simple as:

@keyframes fadein {
    from { opacity: 0; }
    to   { opacity: 1; }
}

I decided to stagger the animations a little bit as well in the hopes of introducing text at the approximate reading speed of the user. I&#39;m pretty happy with the timings now, but might ask my friends for some feedback.

I&#39;m also still deciding whether or not I should change the text color / font size for my welcome message. At the moment, the text is a bold white with a subtle black outline, and is fairly distinguishable from the background image. Considering that much of the picture is brilliantly white with snow however, I darker color may be more suitable. I think it looks fine as it is, but this is another area where outside input may be useful.

At any rate, progress continues! I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to fully flesh out the &quot;About Me&quot; section by the end of the day, but I&#39;ll at least try to write an outline to ensure that I communicate the key messages I&#39;d like to share. 

It&#39;s a very calm and quiet Sunday here in Pocatello, but I suppose they all are in this sleepy mountain town.

Until next time,

-Joe</p>
