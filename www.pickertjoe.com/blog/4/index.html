            <p class='content-markdown'>I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s been another one of those high-effort, low productivity days so far. 

I began my morning by browsing some Bootstrap templates to find some inspiration for my own website design. After finding one that I really liked, I decided I&#39;d try to integrate the existing components of my site into this template to accelerate its development. But after an hour of trying in vain to import my content, I decided that it&#39;d ultimately be better to continue designing my site from scratch. 

Although the template was beautiful, and looked extremely professional, it incorporated a lot of CSS styling and Javascript animations that I was totally unfamiliar with. While it would certainly be instructional to slowly comb through each one and learn by osmosis, I ultimately think it&#39;s in my best interest to make the code behind this site as original as I possibly can. It may not be as beautiful as what the pros can make, but that&#39;s ultimately not the point of this project.

The objective of all this is to demonstrate my acquired skills in Django, HTML, and CSS, and to create a platform to exhibit my future development as a programmer.

So for now, I&#39;ll keep chipping away at the front end, picking up small lessons in this tech stack until I have a product that I&#39;m proud to share with the world.
