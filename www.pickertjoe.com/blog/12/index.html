            <p class='content-markdown'>Well, it&#39;s finally here. My website has officially joined the internet! And while I&#39;m incredibly happy and proud for having reached this milestone, I&#39;m also feeling a mix of frustration and resignation at the amount of work that remains to be done here.

One of the first things to jump out at me when I loaded my site for the first time on a different computer was how clunky and distorted the parallax feature appeared on my &#39;About Me&#39; page. Considering that I used some absolute sizing criteria in my css code, I suppose I should have expected this to be a problem. Sometimes though, these things don&#39;t become noticeable until you really put them to the test. 

This, in addition to the struggles I encountered trying to find a suitable background container for the page, has made me consider doing away with the parallax all together. Instead, I might try to implement a carousel feature in hopes that it will make the page cleaner and more friendly to a wider array of screen resolutions.

Additionally, I noticed almost immediately that several of my static images aren&#39;t being served properly, mainly in the project portfolio. I&#39;ll need to go back through my files and ensure that they&#39;re all in their proper places within my STATIC_ROOT and that my static files were collected properly when I initially pushed the project to Heroku. 

Finally, I just realized that I made the mistake of forgetting to add my settings.py file to my .gitignore before modifying my security settings. As a result, the secret key value was pushed to my GitHub. Thankfully, I was able to resolve this issue as soon as I realized it occurred, and am grateful that I was able to learn such an important security lesson from a relatively low-stakes mistake. 

To be entirely honest, I think I might take a break from this site before diving back in to make the final push to completion. I&#39;ve devoted basically every ounce of my free time for the past three weeks trying to finish this project. On top of my full time job and online class, it&#39;s been a lot, and I think I would benefit tremendously from returning to this project in a week or two with fresh eyes.

In the meantime, I&#39;ll just keep plugging away at my self-study in data structures and sharing my progress with this blog. While I might feel a bit disappointed and deflated now, I also need to recognize this accomplishment. I built this website from absolutely nothing (both code and knowledge-wise) in less than a month, and I deserve to be proud of myself for getting this far.
