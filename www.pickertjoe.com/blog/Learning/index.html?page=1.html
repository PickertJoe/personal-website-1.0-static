            <p>Can you believe it’s almost the end of July? I certainly can’t.

Over the weekend, I decided to ease off the gas pedal a little bit with respect to my coding work. I’ve been pushing really hard for the past two and a half months, and I could use a little break. Thankfully for me, my long awaited trip to Mexico City is coming up in just two weeks, and I can hardly wait!

            <p>So the first order of business in renovating and improving my website will be migrating all of my static and media files to a remotely-hosted S3 bucket provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Not only will this provide faster loading times for many of my website’s features, but it will also ensure that my files are accessible in the first place.

While working on this website, I&#39;ve also been working my way through the second edition of *Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python* by Bradley Miller and David Ranum. Since I have little in the way of academic background in compute...</p>

I finally managed to resolve my CSS customization issue yesterday. Through pointed and dedicated Google searching, I stumbled upon a StackExchange question that addressed my problem succinctly. Earlier, my primary issue had been that I didn&#39;t know where to download the Bootstrap CSS and Javascript files in the context of my Django directory. 

And so this was how I learned about st...</p>

            <p>More so than perhaps any other practice, programming can take you to the highest highs of satisfaction and the lowest lows of frustration. My work on this website earlier this morning was a prime example of this duality.

I started off by finishing the basic functionality of the &#39;blog&#39; app. Now, visitors will be able to visit the neatly laid out index page and click on a snippet of any past entr...</p>
