            <p>Today’s work has been almost entirely cosmetic, and it’s starting to drive me up the wall. 

I’ll be the first to admit that design has never been one of my strong suits, and creating an aesthetically pleasing front end of my website has continued to be one of my greatest points of frustration. 

Today, I began work on the revamped version of my homepage. As mentioned previously, I want my hom...</p>

            <p>What an interesting past 24 hours this has been.

I&#39;ve travelled down through the depths of frustration and back up to the summits of triumphant success. And in the process, I&#39;ve made some really tremendous improvements to my site that have significantly improved it scalability and functionality. 

As I mentioned yesterday, I&#39;ve been trying to transfer the hosting of my sites static and media ...</p>

            <p>So the first order of business in renovating and improving my website will be migrating all of my static and media files to a remotely-hosted S3 bucket provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Not only will this provide faster loading times for many of my website’s features, but it will also ensure that my files are accessible in the first place. 

Because Heroku, my site’s hosting platform, uses ...</p>

While I was gone, I thought of a few changes that I’d like to implement on this website to make it more simple, streamlined, and interesting to the user. My intended audience for this site will be potential employers, recruiters, and anyone else who might want access to my services. As a result...</p>
