            <p class='content-markdown'>Today&#39;s work has been all &quot;About Me.&quot;

Sorry for the terrible pun, but I had to do it. 

Since formatting all of the images in my parallax scroll-down feature, I&#39;ve been working assiduously to flesh out the &quot;About Me&quot; page. In essence, I want this page to serve as a softer, in-depth resume to capture some of my skills and experiences that can&#39;t be conveyed as well by bullet points on my official CV. While I certainly want to include some light-hearted things about myself, I also want to demonstrate how my broad range of life experiences has equipped me to be successful in a broad range of circumstances. 

Of all the different parts of my website, I feel like I&#39;ll need the most feedback on this page. Whenever I get really into writing, I can easily veer off on tangents that might feel personally important to me but would be utterly irrelevant to an average reader. Though I made an outline of the main points I wanted to cover before starting this section, I&#39;ll definitely be seeking a second (or third or fourth!) set of eyes to go over my work.

In other news, I successfully implemented a hide button on my home screen that allows the user to hide the welcome message if they&#39;d rather just enjoy the background shot of Mt. Elbert. This just involved creating this simple javascript function at the bottom of my homepage&#39;s html template:

&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;
    function toggle_visibility() {
        var e = document.getElementById(&#39;welcome&#39;);
        if(e.style.display == &#39;block&#39;)
            e.style.display = &#39;none&#39;;
        else
            e.style.display = &#39;block&#39;;
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

The only problem I&#39;m having with it so far is that you have to click the button twice for it to work. Additionally, I&#39;m still feeling mildly unsure about the white fill/black outline color scheme I&#39;ve chose for my text. It&#39;s decently readable, and nothing else I&#39;ve tried has looked as good, but I still feel that it could be improved.

That&#39;s all for today. Day by day, this website is getting closer and closer to where I want it to be, and I remain immensely proud of how it&#39;s turned out so far.
