            <p class='content-markdown'>What a tremendously exciting day it&#39;s been! And it&#39;s not even 3 o clock yet!

Much to my delight, I was able to find a quick and relatively straightforward solution to the image pathway issue I was experiencing with my Project model. Yesterday, I&#39;d been trying to use the FilePathField model to assign images to my projects on the admin site. But as I described in my last post, I wasn&#39;t able to make the images I associated with each object in the model class render on the HTML template.

To work around this issue, I decided to try a new approach: uploading media files.

Typically, the media directory within a Django project is used to host user-uploaded files and data for a site. Because I will be the only person to ever modify this site, I thought I didn&#39;t need to bother with configuring this part of my settings. But as I discovered, doing so solved this major headache rather painlessly. 

I started by creating a directory titled &#39;media&#39; within the main branch of my Django project. I then added the following lines to my setting.py file:

![Establishment of media directory][1]

These two lines told Python where to look when trying to access necessary media files.

Then, I modified the Project model class in the models.py file in my projects directory by replacing the FileFieldPath model with the ImageField model:

![Code changes to setting.py][2]

The only argument for this new model, upload_to=&#39;images/&#39;, told Python to upload the image I designated on the admin site to the images subdirectory in my media folder. Then, crucially, I was able to successfully link each project to its respectively chosen picture using:

src=&quot;{{project.image.url}}&quot;

You&#39;d probably laugh at me if you could see how excited I got when this finally worked.

With that massive monkey off of my back, I spend a while standardizing and cleaning up the format of my project portfolio, and even attached URLs to each project that link to the source code on my GitHub! I&#39;m really proud of my work on this aspect today, and was extremely encouraged by how quickly I&#39;m beginning to grasp the structure of Django.

The second main focus of my efforts today was on implementing pagination on my blog&#39;s homepage. As I intend to continue writing these posts well into my programming journey, I needed a way to split up the collection of all my entries so they didn&#39;t print out on my blog index as one massive list. After bouncing between a few different tutorials, I finally found one by this Finnish guy Salumi Natri that simple and easy to understand. 

First, I had to modify the blog_index function in my views.py file for the blog app. Fortunately for me, Django has a built-in paginator app that made the back end implementation of this feature fairly straightforward. Here&#39;s what my code looked like:

![Code changes to models.py][3]

With the hard part out of the way, I just had to implement this on the front end, and I had Salumi&#39;s tutorial and Bootstrap&#39;s documentation to help me out. As Salumi was using a different styling CDN than me, I ended up using a blend of his method and the basic pagination bar found on Bootstrap&#39;s documentation website. 

Here&#39;s what my code looked like in my HTML template for my blog&#39;s homepage:

![Paginator implementation][4]

At this point, the only things I can think of to do before getting my site ready for launch are revise the &quot;About Me&quot; section one more time, remodel the show/hide button on my homepage, and test everything twice over to make sure it&#39;s ready to go.

I&#39;m so, so excited to have this site up and running, and if I can have it online by the time I leave for Colorado next Wednesday, I&#39;ll be ecstatic!
