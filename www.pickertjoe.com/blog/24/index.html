            <p class='content-markdown'>Apologies for the lag in posting lately, but I&#39;m just bouncing back from a nasty illness. 

I got really sick on Tuesday night, and could hardly get out of bed the past two days. While the externally-imposed break was nice in some respects, it was also a major bummer because I wasn&#39;t able to attend my company&#39;s conference for interns this week. Of all the times to get sick, it just had to be this week.

Oh well, at least I was able to stay somewhat productive. While I spent most of my time in bed sleeping and playing Runescape, I also managed to create a nifty new app for my site.

[This program][1] fetches current weather data for six of my top travel destinations and reports the information in a clean, stylized format. 

Here&#39;s a screenshot of how it looks:

This app relies on the free API available at [Open Weather Map][3], and simply calls the address with the name of each of the six cities I chose. Then, it sifts through the JSON reply to store the high temperature, low temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of conditions in a dictionary. This dictionary serves as the context that the view function passes the HTML template. For the HTML template itself, I used the same basic format as my home page with only a few slight modifications. 

Another exciting change can be found over on the &quot;About Me&quot; page. At the bottom of the page, you can now find a handy download button that links [the most recent version of my resume][4]. Somehow, seven months had gone by since I last updated it, so it was nice to finally get that long-neglected task of my to-do list.

Short of finally figuring out how to develop a GUI to fit on top of my puzzle solving application, the last major projects I have on my radar are a simple budgeting assistant and another API-based application for NBA player stats. Ideally, I&#39;d like to develop both of them within the confines of my current website, as this will allow me to feature the apps in action in my project portfolio.

As always, I&#39;m sure some minor cosmetic things might continue to come up for my website, but I&#39;m really satisfied and proud with how it&#39;s turned out. It&#39;s crazy to think that a mere month a half ago, nothing about this website even existed.

At any rate, that&#39;s enough for now.

Happy Friday everyone!

-Joe
