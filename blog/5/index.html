            <p class='content-markdown'>We&#39;ve got some exciting work on our hands today!

Last night, I watched a video tutorial on how to implement a simple parallax scrolling feature in CSS, and it inspired me to try to incorporate one into my site. Since I&#39;ve already planned to use a carousel feature on my &quot;Project Portfolio&quot; page, I figured the &quot;About Me&quot; page might be a good place to use the parallax. Since I&#39;d like to include some information about my hobbies as well as my technical/professional skills there, I think some pictures and the interactive aspect of the parallax would really add to the page&#39;s value. 

My goal is to have a fully functioning parallax scrolling feature with all of the pictures I&#39;d like to use by the end of the day. Then, over the weekend, I&#39;d like to flesh out the rest of page with text describing everything. That feels manageable, and I&#39;m excited to see the page come to life.

In other news, I finally discovered why some of the changes I was making to my custom.css file were not being reflected in my website. Up to this point, I hadn&#39;t been aware that previous versions of my site were being cached to reduce loading time. Though this will certainly be a useful feature once my site is near completion, it was proving to be quite inconvenient during development. Thanks once again to the community over at StackExchange, I found a quick band-aid solution to this problem.

To prevent my browser from caching previous versions of my website, I simply included the meta tag:

&quot;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;pragma&quot; content=&#39;no-cache&#39; /&gt;&quot;

in my base.html document. Once my site is closer to deployment, I&#39;ll likely remove this tag as caching can improve the user&#39;s experience significantly. 

At any rate, that&#39;s all I have for now. Hopefully I&#39;ll have good news to share about the parallax development in the near future!
