            <p class='content-markdown'>So let&#39;s start with the good news first.

My puzzle solver program is now fully functional as a terminal application! I was able to implement all 10 of the desired featured I wrote about [two posts ago][1]. For a few simple test cases, all of my algorithms and methods appear to working correctly, though I still need to implement further testing. Having never written unit tests before in C++, thi...</p>

Don&#39;t get me wrong, C++ is an enchanting language in many ways. But after having spent such a long time away from it, I&#39;ve slow to readjust. Working on this new project has really underscored to me how accustomed I had become to Python&#39;s easy-going and flexible nature as an interpreted language. 

Thus far, I think my biggest struggle in C++ has been to...</p>

            <p class='content-markdown'>Happy Wednesday everyone!

I’m happy to announce that I’ve officially began working on my second major project. After writing my last blog post on Monday, I spent a few hours puzzling over what I wanted to focus on now that my website’s reached a more polished state.

At first I had a hard time settling on anything.

Part of me wanted to make another type of web-based app with extensive API ...</p>

            <p class='content-markdown'>I’ve been sitting on this idea for a while, but I feel like now’s a good time to lay some of my feelings out there.

When I set out on this journey to teach myself programming, I had no idea what I was in for. I knew that it would be difficult, as all self-motivated things are, but I never imagined how frustrated, how lost, and how discouraged I would feel at times. While I’ve been able to incor...</p>

            <p class='content-markdown'>I won&#39;t lie, I was sorely tempted to completely abandon the work I&#39;ve done on my website and switch over to a sleek, pre-made template yesterday. I&#39;d reached a point where I felt immensely frustrated by my lack of design skill, and was dismayed by the hours spent trying out new designs only to have them look jarring and sophomoric.

But boy, am I glad that I stuck it out.

These were the prima...</p>
